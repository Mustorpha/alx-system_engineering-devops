# 0x00 SHELL PERMISSIONS

# Learning requirements
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# Permissions
- What do the commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp do
- Linux file permissions
- How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
- How to change permissions, owner and group of a file
- Why can’t a normal user chown a file
- How to run a command with root privileges
- How to change user ID or become superuser

# Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
