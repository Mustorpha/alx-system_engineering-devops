1. **Server**: This is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network. In this case, it hosts our web server, application server, and database.

2. **Domain Name (foobar.com)**: This is the address where internet users can access your website. It's used to find and identify servers on the internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are hard to remember, so the domain system was developed to assign a unique name to each IP address.

3. **DNS Record (www in www.foobar.com)**: 'www' is a type of DNS record known as a CNAME (Canonical Name). It's used to specify that a domain name is an alias for another domain, the "canonical" domain.

4. **Web Server (Nginx)**: This is a software that serves web pages. When a user requests a web page, the web server fetches the requested page from the application server and sends it to the user's browser.

5. **Application Server**: This is a software framework that serves the web application (your codebase). It performs operations such as reading and writing to the database, processing data, and more.

6. **Database (MySQL)**: This is where data is stored and retrieved. In a web application, data such as user profiles, posts, comments etc., are stored in the database.

7. **Communication Protocol**: The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. When a user wants to access your website, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested content.

However, this infrastructure has some issues:

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: Since everything is hosted on a single server, if that server goes down, the entire website goes down.

- **Downtime during Maintenance**: If you need to deploy new code or the web server needs to be restarted, the website will be unavailable during that time.

- **Scalability Issues**: If there's too much incoming traffic, a single server may not be able to handle the load. This setup doesn't allow for easy scaling up (adding more resources to handle more traffic).

This is a basic setup suitable for small applications. For larger, high-traffic applications, one may consider a more robust infrastructure with multiple servers, load balancers, and more.
