**Why are we adding these elements?**

1. **Servers**: We add two servers to distribute the load and to provide redundancy. If one server fails, the other can still serve user requests, reducing the risk of downtime.

2. **Web Server (Nginx)**: This serves static files and proxies dynamic requests to the application server.

3. **Application Server**: This runs your application code. It can be a framework like Django, Flask, etc.

4. **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: This distributes incoming requests to the servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.

5. **Database (MySQL)**: This stores and retrieves your application data.

**Load Balancer Configuration**

The load balancer can be configured with various algorithms, such as Round Robin, Least Connections, or IP Hash. Round Robin, for example, distributes requests evenly across all servers in rotation.

**Active-Active vs Active-Passive Setup**

In an Active-Active setup, all servers are handling traffic. This increases capacity and reliability. In an Active-Passive setup, the passive server only starts handling traffic if the active server fails. This provides a failover mechanism but doesn't increase capacity.

**Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster**

In a Primary-Replica setup, the primary node handles writes and updates, while the replica nodes handle read queries. This helps distribute the database load.

**Issues with this Infrastructure**

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**: The load balancer can become a SPOF. If it fails, the entire system becomes inaccessible.

2. **Security Issues**: Without a firewall or HTTPS, the system is vulnerable to attacks and data interception.

3. **No Monitoring**: Without monitoring, it's difficult to detect issues or understand the system's performance.
